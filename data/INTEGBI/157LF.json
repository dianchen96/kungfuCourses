{"depart": "Integrative Biology", "name": "Ecosystems of California", "prereq": ["Biology  1B"], "number": "157LF", "units": "4", "descrp": "The ecosystems of California are studied from both an ecological and historical biogeographical perspective with a focus on terrestrial plant communities. Students learn how to identify about 150 species of native plants (mostly trees, but also other dominant plants from the non-forest biomes). Field trips occur each Friday and over several weekends. Students conduct group projects that involve plant inventories and data collection as well as how to collect plant specimens and use the Herbarium."}
