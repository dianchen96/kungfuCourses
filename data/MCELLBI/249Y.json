{"units": "2", "descrp": "This course will focus on mechanisms of gene control in vertebrate animals, particularly in the area of vertebrate development. Amphibian egg formation, mesoderm induction, neural induction, and patterning of the nervous system at the molecular level. Control of transcription, post-transcriptional control of gene expression (including control of RNA turnover and RNA localization).", "depart": "Molecular and Cell Biology", "number": "249Y", "name": "Mechanisms of Gene Control in Vertebrate Animals"}
