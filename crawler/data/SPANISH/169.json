It focuses on questions of syntax, lexicon, diction, dialogue, genre, ideology, & language variation, seeking to characterize different types of discourse (such as journalism, scientific writing, fiction, legal writing, or advertising) in Spanish & English, while comparing the structures of these languages to highlight style variation & narrative structure as cognitive strategies for processing real or imaginary events. Readings include theoretical texts on style & narrative, & students will comment on texts to develop a critical perspective about theoretical approaches & narrative techniques."}
