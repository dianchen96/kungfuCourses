{"depart": "Molecular and Cell Biology", "name": "Fundamentals of Molecular and Cell Biology", "prereq": ["Molecular and Cell Biology 200A", "Molecular and Cell Biology 200B"], "number": "200A", "units": "3", "descrp": "The goal of this course is to provide graduate-level instruction on molecular and cellular biosciences from a highly-integrated systems perspective, rather than using a more classic, techniques-oriented format. A collection of approaches, and a focus on critical thinking and problem solving, will be used to show how fundamental, highly-significant biological problems are \"cracked open.\" Reading will be assigned from a mix of classic and current peer-reviewed papers selected by the instructors."}
