Students will be taught the conceptual underpinnings of genome assembly, annotation, and analysis. They will be provided with unassembled output of automated DNA sequencers, and will produce a fully assembled and annotated genome by the end of the semester. Preference will be given to Molecular and Cell Biology graduate students."}
