{"depart": "Economics", "name": "Foundations of Psychology and Economics", "prereq": ["Economics 201A", "Economics 201B"], "number": "219A", "units": "3", "descrp": "This course presents psychological and experimental economics research demonstrating departures from perfect rationality, self-interest, and other classical assumptions of economics and explores ways that these departures can be mathematically modeled and incorporated into mainstream positive and normative economics. The course will focus on the behavioral evidence itself, especially on specific formal assumptions that capture the findings in a way that can be used by economists. Economic applications will be used for illustrative purposes, but the course will emphasize formal theory."}
