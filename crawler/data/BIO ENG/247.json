{"depart": "Bioengineering", "name": "Principles of Synthetic Biology", "prereq": ["Math  53", "Math  54", "Chemistry C 130"], "number": "247", "units": "4", "descrp": "The field of synthetic biology is quickly emerging as potentially one of the most important and profound ways by which we can understand and manipulate our physical world for desired purposes. In this course, the field and its natural scientific and engineering basis are introduced. Relevant topics in cellular and molecular biology and biophysics, dynamical and engineering systems, and design and operation of natural and synthetic circuits are covered in a concise manner that then allows the student to begin to design new biology-based systems."}
