{"depart": "Integrative Biology", "name": "Ecological Genetics", "prereq": ["Biology  1B"], "number": "162", "units": "4", "descrp": "This course integrates ecology, genetics, and evolutionary biology. It presents contemporary approaches to studying evolution in natural populations, including analyzing heritability of ecologically important traits, using molecular techniques to decompose genotypes, documenting and measuring the magnitude of selection in natural systems, and using models to predict evolution in natural populations. Case studies are used to examine evolutionary effects of ecological interactions among organisms, the importance of population size and structure, and interactions among populations through migration and dispersal."}
