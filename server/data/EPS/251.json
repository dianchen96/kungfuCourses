{"units": "3", "descrp": "In this course, we will focus on the (unsolved) puzzle of the contemporary carbon cycle. Why is the concentration of atmospheric CO2 changing at the rate observed? What are the terrestrial and oceanic processes that add and remove carbon from the atmosphere? What are the processes responsible for long-term storage of carbon on land and in the sea? Emphasis will be placed on the observations and modeling needed to evaluate hypotheses about carbon sources and sinks. Past records will be examined for clues about sensitivity of carbon processes to climate variations.", "depart": "Earth and Planetary Science", "number": "251", "name": "Carbon Cycle Dynamics"}
