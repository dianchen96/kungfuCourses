{"depart": "Integrative Biology", "name": "Motor Control", "prereq": ["Integrative Biology 131", "Integrative Biology 132", "Must be taken concurrently with  127L"], "number": "127", "units": "2", "descrp": "Control of human posture, locomotion, and voluntary movements. We start with control at the spinal level: how muscle mechanics, properties of muscle and skin mechanoreceptors and simple spinal connections permit control of a wide variety of movements. We then study the anatomy and physiology of motor systems of the brain. Finally, we use principles of control and information theories to synthesize knowledge of these elements to understand the control systems that regulate posture, locomotion, and voluntary movements."}
