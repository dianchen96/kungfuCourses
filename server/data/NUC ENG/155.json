{"depart": "Nuclear Engineering", "name": "Introduction to Numerical Simulations in Radiation Transport", "prereq": ["Mathematics  53", "Mathematics  54"], "number": "155", "units": "3", "descrp": "Computational methods used to analyze radiation transport described by various differential, integral, and integro-differential equations. Numerical methods include finite difference, finite elements, discrete ordinates, and Monte Carlo. Examples from neutron and photon transport; numerical solutions of neutron/photon diffusion and transport equations. Monte Carlo simulations of photon and neutron transport. An overview of optimization techniques for solving the resulting discrete equations on vector and parallel computer systems."}
