{"depart": "Education", "name": "Excellence and Equity ", "prereq": [], "number": "278B", "units": "3", "descrp": "The design of this course starts from the assumption that the question of \"what works\" in schools is not easily answered. Much of it depends on what sorts of outcomes educators value and hinges on specific conditions schools and districts face. The course aims at developing and refining judgment by looking in-depth at improvement strategies, interventions, or levers for change employed by urban school districts. Given that the theme of the course is school improvement and, given LEEP students' administrative and leadership expertise, the course is envisioned as an opportunity for deep reflection and exchange among knowledgeable actors."}
