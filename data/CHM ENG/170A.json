{"depart": "Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering", "name": "Biochemical Engineering", "prereq": ["Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering 150B", "Biology  1A"], "number": "170A", "units": "3", "descrp": "The first of a two-semester sequence intended to introduce chemical engineers to the basic concepts of biochemical engineering. The course focuses on the use of chemical engineering skills and principles in the analysis and design of biologically-based processes. No previous background in the biological sciences has been assumed, and no subsection of the course has been set aside to cover fundamental topics in biochemistry, molecular biology, or microbiology. Instead, such material will be introduced as necessary throughout the course. The main emphasis of the 170A-170B sequence will be on biochemical kinetics, heat and mass transfer, thermodynamics, and transport phenomena as they apply to enzyme catalysis, protein engineering, microbial growth and metabolism, fermentation and bioreactor design, product recovery and downstream processing."}
