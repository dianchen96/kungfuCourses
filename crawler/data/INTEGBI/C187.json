H. sapiens faced problems of dispersal, colonization, and extinction, and adapted in a variety of ways to the diversity of insular ecosystems. A dual evolutionary model takes into account cultural evolution and transmission, as well as biological evolution of human populations. This course also explores the impacts of human populations on isolated and fragile insular ecosystems, and the reciprocal effects of anthropogenic change on human cultures. Also listed as Anthropology C124C."}
