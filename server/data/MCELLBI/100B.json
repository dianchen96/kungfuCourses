{"depart": "Molecular and Cell Biology", "name": "Biochemistry", "prereq": ["Chemistry C 130"], "number": "100B", "units": "4", "descrp": "We survey cellular metabolic pathways, with focus on the underlying chemistry, bioenergetics, and mechanisms.  We discuss signaling in the context of a physical chemical understanding of diffusion, transport and molecular interactions.  We will highlight the intertwining of signaling and dysregulation with metabolic disorders and cancer, and the production of renewable chemicals such as biofuels.  The course is designed for majors in the biochemistry and molecular biology, genetics and development, or immunology emphases."}
