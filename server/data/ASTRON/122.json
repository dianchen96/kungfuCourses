This will be followed by three to five observational astronomical measurements using an infrared detector array on the instructional telescopes at Leuschner Observatory to study the Jovian planets; moons and rings; interstellar extinction and the colors of stars; regions of star formation; and using the infrared Tully-Fisher method to estimate distances to galaxies."}
