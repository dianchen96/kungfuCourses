{"depart": "Civil and Environmental Engineering", "name": "Numerical Methods for Environmental Flow Modeling", "prereq": ["Civil and Environmental Engineering 200A"], "number": "200B", "units": "3", "descrp": "Introduction to numerical methods with application to environmental flows (atmospheric, surface water, and subsurface flows). Scalar advection/ diffusion equations used to study finite difference schemes, numerical errors and stability. Methods introduced for solving Navier-Stokes equations and for turbulence modeling with Reynolds-averaging and large-eddy simulation. Basic programming skills required for hands-on exercises."}
