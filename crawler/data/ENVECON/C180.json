{"depart": "Environmental Economics and Policy", "name": "Ecological Economics in Historical Context", "prereq": ["Economics  100A"], "number": "C180", "units": "3", "descrp": "Economists through history have explored economic and environmental interactions, physical limits to growth, what constitutes the good life, and how economic justice can be assured. Yet economists continue to use measures and models that simplify these issues and promote bad outcomes. Ecological economics responds to this tension between the desire for simplicity and the multiple perspectives needed to understand complexity in order to move toward sustainable, fulfilling, just economies. Also listed as Energy and Resources Group C180."}
