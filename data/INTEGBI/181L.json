{"depart": "Integrative Biology", "name": "Paleobotany ", "prereq": [], "number": "181L", "units": "4", "descrp": "Introduction to the evolution of plants and terrestrial ecosystems through time. From the invasion of land to the present, we will follow the evolution of major plant groups through important moments of the Phanerozoic eon (the past 540 million years). By studying fossilized plant assemblages, we will interpret how major environmental changes unfolded across landscapes in the past and how plants have influenced the shaping of our planet. Lectures will be complemented by an interactive laboratory covering paleobotanical research techniques, study of fossil and living plant form and function in the lab and field, and analysis of peer-reviewed literature."}
