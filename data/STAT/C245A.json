The course provides a broad theoretical framework for understanding the properties of commonly-used and more advanced methods.  Emphasis is on estimation in nonparametric models in the context of contingency tables, regression (e.g., linear, logistic), density estimation and more.  Topics include maximum likelihood and loss-based estimation, asymptotic linearity/normality, the delta method, bootstrapping, machine learning, targeted maximum likelihood estimation.  Comprehension of broad concepts is the main goal, but practical implementation in R is also emphasized.  Basic knowledge of probability/statistics and calculus are assume Also listed as Public Health C240A."}
