{"depart": "Electrical Engineering", "name": "Laboratory in the Mechanics of Organisms", "prereq": ["Integrative Biology  135", "Electrical Engineering  105", "Electrical Engineering 120"], "number": "C145O", "units": "3", "descrp": "Introduction to laboratory and field study of the biomechanics of animals and plants using fundamental biomechanical techniques and equipment. Course has a series of rotations involving students in experiments demonstrating how solid and fluid mechanics can be used to discover the way in which diverse organisms move and interact with their physical environment. The laboratories emphasize sampling methodology, experimental design, and statistical interpretation of results. Latter third of course devoted to independent research projects. Written reports and class presentation of project results are required. Also listed as Integrative Biology C135L and Bioengineering C136L."}
