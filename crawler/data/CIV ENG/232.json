Finite elasticity; invariance. Energy principles: principles of virtual and complementary virtual work; primary and mixed variational principles. Theory of stability: Euler method; stability under follower loads. Classical theories of beams: planar, torsional, and lateral buckling. Plate theories. Invariant theories of structural mechanics: directed continua; Cosserat theories of rods."}
