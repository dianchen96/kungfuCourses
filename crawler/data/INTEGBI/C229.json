{"depart": "Integrative Biology", "name": "Introduction to Climate Modeling", "prereq": ["Integrative Biology 106A"], "number": "C229", "units": "3", "descrp": "This course emphasizes the fundamentals of the climate system via a hierarchy of climate models. Topics will include energy balance, numerical techniques, climate observations, atmospheric and oceanic circulation and heat transports, and parameterizations of eddy processes. The model hierarchy will also explore nonlinear and stochastic processes, and biogeochemistry. Students will build computational models to investigate climate feedbacks, climate sensitivity, and response times. Also listed as Earth and Planetary Science C229."}
