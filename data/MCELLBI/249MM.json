In development a single cell goes through a series of repeated divisions and these cells read the program encoded in their DNA in order to become familiar cell types such as those found in muscle, liver, or our brains. The goal of our lab is to uncover the rules behind these decisions with the objective of predicting and manipulating developmental programs from just looking at DNA sequence. In order to reach this predictive understanding we combine physics, synthetic biology, and new technologies to query and control developmental decisions in real time at the single cell level in the fruit fly embryo."}
