{"depart": "Earth and Planetary Science", "name": "Structural Geology and Tectonics", "prereq": ["Earth and Planetary Science 50"], "number": "116", "units": "3", "descrp": "Introduction to the geometry and mechanics of brittle and ductile geologic structures; their origins and genetic relation to stress fields and their use as kinematic indicators; case histories of selected regions to elucidate tectonic evolution in different plate tectonic settings. Laboratory exercises will focus on analysis of hand specimens and structural relations portrayed on geologic maps. Several trips to observe geologic structures in the field to supplement laboratory exercises."}
