{"depart": "Electrical Engineering", "name": "Parametric and Optimal Design of MEMS", "prereq": ["Mechanical Engineering  119", "Electrical Engineering C 245"], "number": "C246", "units": "3", "descrp": "Parametric design and optimal design of MEMS. Emphasis on design, not fabrication. Analytic solution of MEMS design problems to determine the dimensions of MEMS structures for specified function. Trade-off of various performance requirements despite conflicting design requirements. Structures include flexure systems, accelerometers, and rate sensors. Also listed as Mechanical Engineering C219."}
