{"depart": "Earth and Planetary Science", "name": "Computer Simulations in Earth and Planetary Sciences", "prereq": ["Math  1A"], "number": "109", "units": "4", "descrp": "Introduction to modern computer simulation methods and their application to selected Earth and Planetary Science problems. In hands-on computer labs, students will learn about numerical algorithms, learn to program and modify provided programs, and display the solution graphically. This is an introductory course and no programming experience is required. Examples include fractals in geophysics, properties of materials at high pressure, celestial mechanics, and diffusion processes in the Earth. Topics range from ordinary and partial differential equations to molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations."}
