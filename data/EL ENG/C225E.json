{"units": "3", "descrp": "Fundamentals of MRI including signal-to-noise ratio, resolution, and contrast as dictated by physics, pulse sequences, and instrumentation. Image reconstruction via 2D FFT methods. Fast imaging reconstruction via convolution-back projection and gridding methods and FFTs. Hardware for modern MRI scanners including main field, gradient fields, RF coils, and shim supplies. Software for MRI including imaging methods such as 2D FT, RARE, SSFP, spiral and echo planar imaging methods. Fundamental tradeoffs of tailoring hardware and pulse sequences to specific applications. The modern MRI \"toolbox\" will be introduced, including selecting a slice or volume, fast imaging methods to avoid image artifacts due to physiologic motion, and methods for functional imaging.
