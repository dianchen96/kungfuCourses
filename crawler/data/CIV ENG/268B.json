{"units": "3", "descrp": "Principles and practices of \"lean\" production are applied to project delivery in the AEC industry. Case studies illustrate the concepts. Project delivery is viewed holistically with a focus on work structuring and supply chain management. Topics include systems dynamics, uncertainty, and variation; materials management; logistics; e-commerce; building information modeling (BIM); and integrated product and process design. Students use process simulation to assess performance of different system configurations and develop a case study applying concepts on a real project.", "depart": "Civil and Environmental Engineering", "number": "268B", "name": "Lean Construction and Supply Chain Management"}
