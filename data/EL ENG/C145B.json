{"depart": "Electrical Engineering", "name": "Medical Imaging Signals and Systems", "prereq": ["Electrical Engineering  20N", "Electrical Engineering  120"], "number": "C145B", "units": "4", "descrp": "Biomedical imaging is a clinically important application of engineering, applied mathematics, physics, and medicine. In this course, we apply linear systems theory and basic physics to analyze X-ray imaging, computerized tomography, nuclear medicine, and MRI. We cover the basic physics and instrumentation that characterizes medical image as an ideal perfect-resolution image blurred by an impulse response. This material could prepare the student for a career in designing new medical imaging systems that reliably detect small tumors or infarcts. Also listed as Bioengineering C165."}
