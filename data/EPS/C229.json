{"depart": "Earth and Planetary Science", "name": "Introduction to Climate Modeling", "prereq": ["Earth and Planetary Science 181", "Integrative Biology  106A"], "number": "C229", "units": "3", "descrp": "This course emphasizes the fundamentals of the climate system via a hierarchy of climate models. Topics will include energy balance, numerical techniques, climate observations, atmospheric and oceanic circulation and heat transports, and parameterizations of eddy processes. The model hierarchy will also explore nonlinear and stochastic processes, and biogeochemistry. Students will build computational models to investigate climate feedbacks, climate sensitivity, and response times. Also listed as Integrative Biology C229."}
