{"depart": "Bioengineering", "name": "Introductory Electronic Transducers Laboratory", "prereq": ["Electrical Engineering  40"], "number": "C145L", "units": "3", "descrp": "Laboratory exercises exploring a variety of electronic transducers for measuring physical quantities such as temperature, force, displacement, sound, light, ionic potential; the use of circuits for low-level differential amplification and analog signal processing; and the use of microcomputers for digital sampling and display. Lectures cover principles explored in the laboratory exercises; construction, response and signal to noise of electronic transducers and actuators; and design of circuits for sensing and controlling physical quantities. Also listed as Electrical Engineering C145L."}
