{"depart": "Public Health", "name": "Case Studies in Environmental and Occupational Epidemiology", "prereq": ["Public Health  250C", "Public Health  241"], "number": "272B", "units": "2", "descrp": "Using published studies as examples, we will focus on key epidemiologic methods as they arise in the study of environmental hazards in the community and workplace. Selected topics include the validity of exposure assessment for both community-based and workplace-based studies, specific forms of selection bias (e.g., healthy worker survivor effect), measurement error (e.g., exposure misclassification), time varying confounding, and analytical methods to model exposure-reponse (e.g., person-years, causal models, spatial anaylsis, and nonlinear models) in environmental and occupational epidemiology. Grades will be based on class participation, homework, and final project."}
