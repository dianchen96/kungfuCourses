{"depart": "Electrical Engineering", "name": "Introduction to Convex Optimization", "prereq": ["Mathematics  54"], "number": "227A", "units": "4", "descrp": "Convex optimization is a class of nonlinear optimization problems where the objective to be minimized, and the constraints, are both convex. Contrarily to the more classical linear programming framework, convex programs often go unrecognized, and this is a pity since a large class of convex optimization problems can now be efficiently solved. In addition, it is possible to address hard, non convex problems (such as \"combinatorial optimization\" problems) using convex approximations that are more efficient than classical linear ones. The course covers some convex optimization theory and algorithms, and describes various applications arising in engineering design, machine learning and statistics, finance, and operations research. The course includes labatory assignments, which consist of hands-on experiments with the optimization software CVX, and a discussion section."}
