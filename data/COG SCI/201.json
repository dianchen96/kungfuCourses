{"depart": "Cognitive Science", "name": "Graduate Seminar on the Mind and Language", "prereq": [], "number": "201", "units": "4", "descrp": "Thought appears to be grounded in the sensorimotor system, and to grow out of the nature of the physical brain and body; human reason also makes extensive and fundamental use of imaginative mechanisms such as metaphor and metonymy. The readings in this course review that evidence, much of which comes from the study of how people categorize and reason using categories. The course will include both discussions and research projects appropriate to students in each of the disciplines."}
