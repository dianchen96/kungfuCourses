{"depart": "Integrative Biology", "name": "Mammalian Physiology Laboratory", "prereq": ["Previous or concurrent enrollment in  132"], "number": "132L", "units": "2", "descrp": "In the laboratory component of Integrative Biology 132, students gain hands-on experience measuring physiological parameters, interpreting physiological data, designing experiments, and communicating ideas in writing and orally. Guided investigations include measurements of membrane potentials, responses of skeletal muscle to electrical stimulation, electromyography, pulmonary and cardiovascular measurements in humans, contractility and regulation of the frog heart, human electrocardiography, and renal control of body fluids. In two independent investigations, students identify their own questions, develop hypotheses, design and perform experiments, and present their studies in symposia. Background in elementary statistics, data analysis and oral presentation are also provided."}
