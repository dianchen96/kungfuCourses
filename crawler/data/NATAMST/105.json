{"units": "4", "descrp": "This course addresses how Indigenous communities throughout the Americas deal with their contemporary political dilemmas. It explores the ways in which internal colonialism, projects of assimilation, political and economic marginalization, land loss, and resistance have affected how Indigenous people view themselves in relationship to the dominant societies in which they reside. It explores local differences, attentive to the specificity of the national or regional dimension of \"the Indian Problem.\" And it examines the varied and often complimentary tactics that Indigenous people take in their pursuit of political and cultural self-determination.", "depart": "Native American Studies", "number": "105", "name": "Indigenous Issues Across the Americas"}
