{"units": "4", "descrp": "This course considers the evidence for the presence of early Christian believers in the so-called \"Celtic\" areas of western Europe. Students will examine how the Celtic peoples received Christianity in the context of native (pagan) religion; they will look specifically at how the Roman Church doctrine influenced the doctrinal stands of the early Celtic church(es), and vice versa, with particular attention to the Pelagian controversy, the date of Easter, the monastic tonsure, and the use of penitentials. The period covered is approximately 70 CE to 800 CE.", "depart": "Celtic Studies", "number": "173", "name": "Celtic Christianity"}
