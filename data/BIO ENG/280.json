By the end of it, students will have experience communicating their ideas appropriately and effectively to their peers, their superiors, and those whom they manage or mentor. We will also discuss methods for having a successful graduate school experience - choosing and working on a project and preparing to meet post-graduate goals. Finally, some of the ethical challenges likely to be met by a working bioengineer will be explored.
