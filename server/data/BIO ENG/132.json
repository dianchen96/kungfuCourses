{"depart": "Bioengineering", "name": "Genetic Devices", "prereq": ["Engineering  7", "Mathematics  54", "Chemistry  3A"], "number": "132", "units": "4", "descrp": "This senior-level course is a comprehensive survey of genetic devices. These DNA-based constructs are comprised of multiple \"parts\" that together encode a higher-level biological behavior and perform useful human-defined functions. Such constructs are the engineering target for most projects in synthetic biology. Included within this class of constructs are genetic circuits, sensors, biosynthetic pathways, and microbiological functions."}
