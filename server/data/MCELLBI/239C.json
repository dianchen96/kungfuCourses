{"depart": "Molecular and Cell Biology", "name": "The Regulation of Meiotic Gene Expression and Cellular Morphogenesis", "prereq": [], "number": "239C", "units": "2", "descrp": "The mechanisms that link cellular differentiation programs and dynamic gene regulation in complex eukaryotic systems remain mysterious. Such programs drive diverse and central biological processes including organismal development, immune function, disease progression, and meiosis. This course is focused on the molecular basis for the cellular remodeling accompanying meiosis, the highly conserved process by which gametes are produced."}
