Students thus learn actively about a subject by performance of relevant literature and discourse with involved audiences. In this course, selected stories deal with many aspects of medicine in context, e.g. dying, childbearing, aging, living with chronic pain, biomedical ethics, and disparities in care. The stories are presented to audiences such as elders, care-givers, patients, and providers."}
