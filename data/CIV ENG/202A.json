{"depart": "Civil and Environmental Engineering", "name": "Vadose Zone Hydrology", "prereq": ["Civil and Environmental Engineering 173"], "number": "202A", "units": "3", "descrp": "Course addresses fundamental and practical issues in flow and transport phenomena in the vadose zone, which is the geologic media between the land surface and the regional water table. A theoretical framework for modeling these phenomena will be presented, followed by applications in the areas of ecology, drainage and irrigation, and contaminant transport. Hands-on applications using numerical modeling and analysis of real-life problems and field experiments will be emphasized."}
