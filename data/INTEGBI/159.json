Interplay between its components (solid earth, oceans, and atmosphere) governs conditions on the planet's outside that we and other biota inhabit. In turn, life asserts a vast influence on the abiotic components; in fact, the biosphere itself is a crucial system component. We will explore the effect that 3.5 billion years of evolving biosphere had on System Earth and vice versa (e.g., in terms of climate), including the recent human impact on the system."}
