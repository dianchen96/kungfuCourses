{"depart": "Integrative Biology", "name": "The Biology of Sex", "prereq": ["Biology  1B"], "number": "136", "units": "4", "descrp": "The ability to reproduce is a defining characteristic of life, and of great interest to biologists as well as humanity in general. What is sex, and why did it develop? Why do we have sexual reproduction, whereas some animals do not? This course will provide a comprehensive overview on the biology of sex from an evolutionary perspective with an emphasis on humans in comparison to other species. The course will consist of two lectures each week, and a lab where we discuss a paper, watch videos, or have discussion sections on specific topics that were covered in class."}
