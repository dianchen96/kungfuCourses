{"depart": "Integrative Biology", "name": "Paleobiological Perspectives on Ecology and Evolution", "prereq": [], "number": "113L", "units": "4", "descrp": "This course will center around answering the following questions: What do the fossil and geologic records have to tell us about the nature of ecological and evolutionary processes? What do they teach us that cannot be learned from the living world alone? In answering these questions, the course will provide an introduction to the analysis of key problems in paleobiology, with an emphasis on how evolutionary and ecological processes operate on geologic timescales."}
