{"depart": "Integrative Biology", "name": "Comparative Endocrinology", "prereq": ["Biology  1A", "Integrative Biology 1B"], "number": "138", "units": "4", "descrp": "The primary goal of this course is to provide students with a broad understanding of the evolution of hormonal systems. A comparative approach allows us to envisage how the complex mammalian endocrine system presumably evolved from that of more primitive vertebrates. Students will learn about endocrine pathways and endocrine-based behaviors of jawless fishes, fishes, amphibia, reptiles, birds, and mammals. In addition, students will gain an understanding of the experimental methods used in endocrine research. The class teaches students how to read and interpret the primary scientific literature; thus it encourages the critical thinking that is a fundamental skill for any scientist."}
