{"depart": "Geography", "name": "Top Ten Global Environmental Problems", "prereq": ["Geography  40", "ESPM  15"], "number": "137", "units": "4", "descrp": "Conceptualizing global environmental problems is difficult because of the complexity of the issues, the magnitude of the problems, and the different time scales of action versus reaction. These issues apply both to the natural earth system as well as human societies. This course will examine the scientific basis underlying the largest environmental threats, and then reframe the issues to explore the societal basis of those problems. Class is not open to freshmen."}
