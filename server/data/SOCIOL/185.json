{"depart": "Sociology", "name": "Global Sociology", "prereq": ["Sociology 1", "Sociology 3", "Sociology 3AC"], "number": "185", "units": "3", "descrp": "Global sociology seeks to transcend national boundaries, studying the world as a unit unto itself, populated by organizations, networks, and movements. Global sociology cannot be constructed by sociologists from a single country, but it must be a collaborative effort from different parts of the planet. We will study globalization through a sociological lens by asking distinguished sociologists from around the world to discuss such contemporary issues as immigration, terrorism, disasters, etc."}
