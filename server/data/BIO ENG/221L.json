{"depart": "Bioengineering", "name": "BioMEMS and BioNanotechnology Laboratory", "prereq": ["Bioengineering 102", "Bioengineering 22", "Bioengineering 22L", "Chemistry C 130"], "number": "221L", "units": "4", "descrp": "Students will become familiar with BioMEMS and Lab-on-a-Chip research. Students will design and fabricate their own novel micro- or nano-scale device to address a specific problem in biotechnology using the latest micro- and nano-technological tools and fabrication techniques. This will involve an intensive primary literature review, experimental design, and quantitative data analysis. Results will be presented during class presentations and at a final poster symposium."}
