{"units": "4", "descrp": "This course explores human reproduction through the lenses of evolutionary biology, population statistics, and culture. Throughout, we organize the course in terms of major transitions and the question of choice. How do evolved biology and inherited culture make some choices more accessible and others less so? What happened to human fertility and to the possibility of making choices about fertility at such moments of change as the emergence of pair bonding in hominids, the advent of agriculture, the industrial revolution, and today with the development of both contraceptive and prospective technologies.
