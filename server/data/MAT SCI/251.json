{"depart": "Materials Science and Engineering", "name": "Polymer Surfaces and Interfaces", "prereq": ["Chemistry  1A"], "number": "251", "units": "3", "descrp": "The course is designed for graduate students to gain a fundamental understanding of the surface and interfacial science of polymeric materials. Beginning with a brief introduction of the principles governing polymer phase behavior in bulk, it develops the thermodynamics of polymers in thin films and at interfaces, the characterization techniques to assess polymer behavior in thin films and at interfaces, and the morphologies of polymer thin films and other dimensionally-restricted structures relevant to nanotechnology and biotechnology. Field trips to national user facilities, laboratory demonstrations and hands-on experiments, and guest lectures will augment the courses lectures."}
