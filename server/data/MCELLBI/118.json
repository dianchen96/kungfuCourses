{"depart": "Molecular and Cell Biology", "name": "The Cancer Karyotype", "prereq": ["Molecular and Cell Biology 102", "Molecular and Cell Biology 104"], "number": "118", "units": "1", "descrp": "Mutational cancer theories do not explain why cancers: 1) have clonal individual karyotypes; 2) have polygenic transcriptomes and phenotypes; 3) have flexible karyotypes, which evolve progressive malignancy and drug resistance, but maintain autonomy and even immortality; and 4) Why carcinogens induce cancer only after conspicuously long latent periods of years to decades. To answer these questions, this course tests a new karyotypic theory, which postulates that cancers evolve much like new species."}
