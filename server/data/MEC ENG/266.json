{"depart": "Mechanical Engineering", "name": "Dynamics and Stability of Engineering and Geophysical Flows with Rotation", "prereq": ["Mechanical Engineering 260A", "Mechanical Engineering 260B"], "number": "266", "units": "3", "descrp": "A presentation of four related topics in high Reynolds number flow: stability theory, waves, rotating flows, and geophysical/astrophysical fluid dynamics. Linear stability of classical, shear, convecting, and rotating flows are reviewed. Weakly non-linear stability is examined with amplitude equations and numerical studies of sub-critical instabilities of pipe and channel flows are discussed. Rapidly rotating flows are analyzed by asymptotically deriving the quasi-geotrophic and shallow water equations. Examples of geophysical flows include vortex dynamics in the atmosphere and ocean, jet streams and waves (Rossby, Poincare, inertial, internal gravity and Kelvin). The mathematical formulation of hyperbolic waves in stratified, free surface, and compressible flows is discussed and applied to flows with shocks and breaking waves."}
