{"depart": "Computer Science", "name": "Concurrent Models of Computation", "prereq": [], "number": "C219D", "units": "3", "descrp": "Theory and practice of concurrent models of computation (MoCs) with applications to software systems, embedded systems, and cyber-physical systems. Analysis for boundedness, deadlock, and determinacy; formal semantics (fixed point semantics and metric-space models); composition; heterogeneity; and model-based design. MoCs covered may include process networks, threads, message passing, synchronous/reactive, dataflow, rendezvous, time-triggered, discrete events, and continuous time. Also listed as Electrical Engineering C219D."}
