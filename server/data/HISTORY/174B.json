Beginning with the awakening of modern Polish nationalism, it traces the emergence of this Poland through the rise of mass society; the horrifying and exhilarating spectacles of World War I and national and social revolutions; first experiments with modern Polish statehood (especially policies toward ethnic minorities and socially marginalized groups); then the transformations wrought by a half century of totalitarian rule; ethnic cleansing, elite transfer, forces social stratification, and despite all of this, the defiant return of civil society. Students must attend lectures, complete required readings, take two examinations and write a semester paper.", "depart": "History", "number": "174B", "name": "Poles and Others"}
