{"depart": "Earth and Planetary Science", "name": "Isotopic Geochemistry", "prereq": ["Chemistry  1A", "Earth and Planetary Science 1B", "Mathematics  1A", "Earth and Planetary Science 1B"], "number": "124", "units": "4", "descrp": "An overview of the use of natural isotopic variations to study earth, planetary, and environmental problems. Topics include geochronology, cosmogenic isotope studies of surficial processes, radiocarbon and the carbon cycle, water isotopes in the water cycle, and radiogenic and stable isotope studies of planetary evolution, mantle dynamics, volcanoes, groundwater, and geothermal systems. The course begins with a short introduction to nuclear processes and includes simple mathematical models used in isotope geochemistry."}
