{"units": "4", "descrp": "This course will examine Japanese, Jewish, and African responses to and representations of violent conflict. We will pay attention to how catastrophic events are productive of new forms of expression--oral, written, and visual--as well as destructive of familiar ones. We will examine the ways in which experience and its representation interact during and in the aftermath of extreme violence. Our empirical cases will be drawn from our research on comparative Japanese and Jewish responses to WWII atrocities, and on the post-Cold War civil wars in Africa.", "depart": "East Asian Languages and Cultures", "number": "101", "name": "Catastrophe"}
