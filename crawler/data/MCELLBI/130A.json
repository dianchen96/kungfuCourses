{"depart": "Molecular and Cell Biology", "name": "Cell and Systems Biology", "prereq": ["Molecular and Cell Biology 102", "Molecular and Cell Biology 104", "Instructors may waive  104"], "number": "130A", "units": "4", "descrp": "This course will provide a detailed discussion of a wide range of topics in cell biology emphasizing experimental approaches and key experiments that have provided important insights. The course is aimed at conveying an understanding of how cellular structure and function arise as a result of the properties of cellular macromolecules. An emphasis will be placed on the dynamic nature of cellular organization and will include a description of physical properties of cells (dimensions, concepts of free energy, diffusion, biophysical properties). Students will be introduced to quantitative aspects of cell biology and a view of cellular function that is based on integrating multiple pathways and modes of regulation (systems biology)."}
