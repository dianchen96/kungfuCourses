{"depart": "Electrical Engineering", "name": "Introduction to Microelectromechanical Systems ", "prereq": ["Physics  7B"], "number": "147", "units": "3", "descrp": "This senior-level course will introduce undergraduate students to the rapidly expanding, multi-disciplinary field of microfabricated systems. It will present the fundamentals of micromachining and microfabrication techniques (including photolithography, thin film, and bulk etching and deposition and polymer fabrication). The course will then delve into the fundamentals of transduction mechanisms, particularly as they apply to sensing and transduction. Capacitive, piezoresistive, thermal fundamentals will be covered; basic microfluidics will be covered. The course will have a heavy emphasis on multi-domain analysis (i.e., thermal-mechanical, electromechanical analysis). Armed with these basic concepts, the course will cover design and analysis of microfabricated sensors and actuators using these techniques. Many examples of existing devices and their applications will be reviewed."}
