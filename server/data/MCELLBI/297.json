{"depart": "Molecular and Cell Biology", "name": "Methods and Logic in Biology", "prereq": [], "number": "297", "units": "3", "descrp": "The focus of this course will be some of the papers in the scientific literature that provide the discoveries and methods critical to modern molecular and cell biology. Students will learn how to dissect published literature to evaluate precisely what constitutes an important paper. The themes for the methods and logics course will be broadly applicable to all students interested in modern experimental biology. Students will meet and discuss the themes of a series of papers first by themselves (with assistance of a faculty member) and then participate in an in-depth dissection lead by the staff."}
