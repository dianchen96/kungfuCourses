{"depart": "Civil and Environmental Engineering", "name": "Elementary Fluid Mechanics", "prereq": ["Physics  7A", "Mechanical Engineering C 85"], "number": "100", "units": "4", "descrp": "Fluid statics and dynamics, including laboratory experiments with technical reports. Fundamentals: integral and differential formulations of the conservation laws are solved in special cases such as boundary layers and pipe flow. Flow visualization and computation techniques are introduced using Matlab. Empirical equations are used for turbulent flows, drag, pumps, and open channels. Principles of empirical equations are also discussed: dimensional analysis, regression, and uncertainty."}
