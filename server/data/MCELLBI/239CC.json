{"units": "2", "descrp": "Our biophysics laboratory is focused on two intersecting research directions: (I) exploration of biological spatial organization on the mesoscale (10nm-10microns) and (II) characterization of the mechanics of normal and dysplastic cells and tissues. We also invent and refine tools for precision control and characterization of cells and tissues.", "depart": "Molecular and Cell Biology", "number": "239CC", "name": "Biological Spatial Organization and Normal and Dysplastic Cells and Tissues"}
