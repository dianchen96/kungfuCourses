{"depart": "Industrial Engineering and Operations Research", "name": "Financial Engineering Systems I", "prereq": ["Industrial Engineering and Operations Research 221", "Industrial Engineering and Operations Research 172"], "number": "222", "units": "3", "descrp": "Introductory graduate level course, focusing on applications of operations research techniques, e.g., probability, statistics, and optimization, to financial engineering. The course starts with a quick review of 221, including no-arbitrage theory, complete market, risk-neutral pricing, and hedging in discrete model, as well as basic probability and statistical tools. It then covers Brownian motion, martingales, and Ito's calculus, and deals with risk-neutral pricing in continuous time models. Standard topics include Girsanov transformation, martingale representation theorem, Feyman-Kac formula, and American and exotic option pricings. Simulation techniques will be discussed at the end of the semester, and MATLAB (or C or S-Plus) will be used for computation."}
