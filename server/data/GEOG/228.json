{"depart": "Geography", "name": "Spatial Simulation Modeling", "prereq": [], "number": "228", "units": "4", "descrp": "Simulation is now a widely adopted approach to science. This class will examine what simulation models are, and why and how they are used. Models that focus on spatial processes (aggregation, segregation, diffusion, movement, growth) will be closely considered. A particular concern will be to explore how simulation models may help elucidate the relationships between processes and the spatial outcomes they produce."}
